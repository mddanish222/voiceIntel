# VoxIntel AI – Speech Recognition & Transcription System

##  Introduction

VoxIntel AI is a web-based application developed to convert speech into text using AI-powered speech recognition. The system allows users to either record audio through a microphone or upload an audio file and generate accurate text output. The main focus of this project is to provide a simple, user-friendly, and efficient solution for audio transcription.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **API Used:** Deepgram Speech-to-Text API  
- **Database:** MongoDB (used during initial development)  
- **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage (for storing user history)  
- **Other Tools:** jsPDF, GitHub, Netlify, Render

## Features

- Record audio using microphone  
- Upload audio files  
- Audio preview before processing  
- Convert speech into text  
- Copy transcription to clipboard  
- Download transcription as PDF  
- Store transcription history using LocalStorage  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

##  Working of the Project

1. The user opens the application.  
2. The user can either record audio or upload an audio file.  
3. The selected audio is previewed on the screen.  
4. The user clicks on the **Analyze** button.  
5. The audio file is sent to the backend server.  
6. The backend sends the audio to the Deepgram API.  
7. The API processes the audio and returns the transcription.  
8. The transcription is displayed in the output panel.  
9. The result is stored in LocalStorage for future access.
